  Create in your rohan masc account a file with a name like hw1.sql
or prog1.sql of SQL commands that will create the four tables discussed
in class and emailed to you.  As indicated, you will need 4 create
table commands, and 42 insert into commands.

   At the beginning of the tuesday class, hand in the file of SQL 
commands that you made, as hard copy.  The graders will look for the
file as well, in your rohan account, so leave it there.
